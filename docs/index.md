## About

Testcontainers is a library to support tests with throwaway instances of Docker containers for all compatible .NET Standard versions. The library is built on top of the .NET Docker remote API and provides a lightweight implementation to support your test environment in all circumstances.

Choose from existing pre-configured configurations and start containers within a second, to support and run your tests. Or create your own containers with Dockerfiles and run your tests immediately afterward.
